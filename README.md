**Author**: Mohamad Alkhateeb
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We will implement a basic full-stack application for a book list which will include the ability to search the Google Books API.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
.env - with your PORT. Make sure this file is included in your .gitignore
README.md - with documentation regarding your lab and it’s current state of development. Check the “documentation” section below for more details on how that should look AT MINIMUM
.gitignore - with standard NodeJS configurations
.eslintrc.json - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
package.json - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration, including express, ejs, and superagent
Note that the package-lock.json file is automatically created when dependencies are installed and ensures that future installations of the project use the same versions of the dependencies.
